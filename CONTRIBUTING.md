## How Can I Contribute?

## Guide Standards

This project utilizes Sphinx, a documentation generator in Python3.


### Admonitions

At most times, admonitions are generated with the `.. admonition::` directive instead, followed by the admonition title. Its class may vary on what it wants to portray:

- **tip**: Additional useful information regarding that topic.
- **hint**: Examples and alike.

*Unlisted admonition classes will remained used as they are by definition.**


### Links

For a cleaner/readable source code, hyperlinks must be written in **reference** or **targeted form**. Its directives must be placed at the bottom-most part of the source code/file.

```rst
Ths is a reference_. Works for `multiple words`_ too.

.. _reference: https://google.com
.. _multiple words: https://example.com
```


### Glossary

When a word or terminology is used in a page, and it conveys a different meaning than its conceptual/logical meaning, then that term must be added to the page's glossary section.

```rst
[...] :term:`language` [...]

.. glossary::

  Language
    A formal system of rules, vocabulary, and grammatical structures used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute
```

*You may also append a term/noun in the glossary if you simply want to add additional information in regards that matter.*


### Authors attribution

Contributors must attribute their social network, e.g. Github, at the end of the page; the primary/leading author must be the first attributed, followed by co-authors. Example:

```rst
-----

Authors
  -- `Author1@example`_

  -- `Author2@example`_


.. _Author1@example: https://example.com/Author1
.. _Author2@example: https://example.com/Author2
```

If otherwise there was no prior attribution of Authors in the page, which determines that the page was made by the Repository Owner, then therefore you must include the Repository Owner's author attribution, followed by yours, with the following template:

```rst
-----

Authors
  -- `demoutrei@github`_

  -- `Author2@example`_


.. _demoutrei@github: https://github.com/demoutrei
.. _Author2@example: https://example.com/Author2
```

This simply indicates you're editing a part of the content in the page.
